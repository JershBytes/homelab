# coloredbytes's `Homelab`

**Hey, there!**

**I’m Joshua, and I’m passionate about open-source and sharing my Homelab endeavors.**

This Repository **Homelab** contains all my homelab documentation files. Here you'll find notes, setups, and configurations for infrastructure, applications, networking, and more.

## Contribution

As this is my personal Homelab documentation, I don't accept any contributions. But feel free to fork this repository and use it for your own documentation.
